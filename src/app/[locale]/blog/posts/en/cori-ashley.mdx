My name is Cori Ashley, and I’m the CEO and founder of Super Me! Programs and Global Shifts Inc.—a collective of empowerment programs designed to help people discover everything that’s right with them.

Aashni Shah is not only a bright, intuitive, and incredibly capable worker, but she’s also an extraordinary person. From the moment we began collaborating, it was clear that our commonalities and visions aligned perfectly. It’s rare to find someone who possesses both the technical skills to excel at their work and the personal drive to contribute to a better world, but Aashni embodies both qualities effortlessly.

Aashni is prompt, reliable, and an absolute pleasure to work with. Every challenge we’ve presented her has been met with thoughtful solutions and executed with impressive efficiency. She consistently completes tasks in a timely manner and exceeds expectations in the process.

What sets Aashni apart, however, is her ability to uplift and strengthen team dynamics. To me, the interactive experience of working with a team member is paramount, and Aashni fulfills every aspect of this. Her professionalism, positive attitude, and genuine support elevate the energy and connections within any team she’s part of.

I highly, highly recommend working with Aashni Shah. She’s a true asset to any project or organization lucky enough to have her on board.
