## Hey guys, Eid Mubarak!

I have a new idea, which I'm planning on starting as my first official start-up. 
It is called Index Prompts. It will essentially be a way to upload, store, and share prompts for LLMs like ChatGPT.
I know tons of people that are currently storing their prompts in something like google docs, but this will make it far easier to access them.
I am integrating a way to share prompts with others, and find and use prompts that other people share. 

## Extension

There will also be a google extension for it, that will autofill prompts. 

While making the website, I kept having to verify my email and it got annoying, so i made a quick google chrome extension to verify codes from your email.
I'll be uploading the extension soon.
