## Hey — I’m Qendrim Beka.

I’m a second-year computer science student interested in building tools that solve problems, not just look cool in a demo. I work on projects across AI, computer vision, and backend systems — mostly through hackathons, startups, and personal curiosity.

## Why I'm doing this

I didn’t start coding to get better at coding. I started because I wanted to make things that actually work. Whether that’s a Rock Paper Scissors game that recognizes your hand gestures, or a VR system that helps detect early signs of Alzheimer’s, I’m always chasing the “can we ship this?” version of an idea.

## What you’ll find here

This blog is a log of projects, experiments, and problems I ran into along the way. Sometimes I’ll write about code. Sometimes about systems. Sometimes just what I learned by building something under pressure with a small team and no sleep.

If you're building something interesting, reach out. I’m always open to collaboration.
