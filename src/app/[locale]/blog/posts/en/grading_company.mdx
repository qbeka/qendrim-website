## Hey everybody,

I really, really want to make a card grading company. One that ensures a fair, no-bias, customizable grading experience.

## Why I'm doing this

I really like trading cards. And I love the way graded cards look. Sleek, protected, and polished in their slabs. But it feels like every single grading company is so hard to use. I don't want to pay 40$ to grade a single card, and then get charged 200$ more after it comes back a high-value 10. That is stupid. I want a grading company that not only is 100% accurant in their grades, but have custom-innovative slabs, and a better buyer experience.

## Why it will work

Tag does something like this already, but they have weak casing. It can be better. And they don't allow for customizable cases.

## As always, where to find me

I'm going to see this through I think..
