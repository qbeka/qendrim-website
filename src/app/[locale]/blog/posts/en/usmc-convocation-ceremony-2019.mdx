On June 14th 2019, I was invited to be the Guest Speaker for the University of Toronto’s St Michael’s College Convocation Ceremony. To anyone who may be confused about the use of University and College in one title, let me explain it for you. UofT (University of Toronto) has many colleges on campus which act as a community providing academic support, residence accommodation, social activities, athletic pursuits, co-curricular experiences and a lot more. I was part of the St Michael’s College (SMC), where I stayed on campus for the first 2 years. When it comes to graduation time, students usually graduate with the college that they are a part of, with a few exceptions.

On June 14th 2019, I was asked to be the guest speaker for the convocation ceremony. It was truly an honour, and an opportunity to share some of the things I’ve learnt since I graduated. It took many drafts to figure out what message I wanted to share with the students on such an important day, and I thought it would be a good opportunity to share it with anyone else as well.

The ceremony was live streamed and recorded so [you can watch the whole ceremony here](https://strmstr.com/june-14-230-2019.html). My speech specifically starts around the 9-minute mark.

# My Address

<div style="padding: 20px; font-size: 0.8em;">
  <p>Hello everyone! Thank you Professor Ragere for the wonderful introduction, and a good afternoon to the faculty, alumni, parents, friends and most importantly the Graduands.</p>

  <p>3 years ago, I was sitting in one of those seats, eagerly waiting to receive my diploma just like the rest of you. 3 years later, and I’m now standing here in front of all of you on one of the most important days of your lives. Thank you for having me, it truly is an honour.</p>

  <p>I should have probably practiced this speech more, but I was doing what I suspect many of you were doing last night, which is celebrating the Raptors defeating the Golden State Warriors. Last night was an important moment in history. And today, is yours. You’re ending one part of your life and about to start another, and I can’t wait to see what you have in store.</p>

  <p>Since I got the email initially inviting me to speak, I’ve been thinking about my own graduation day, and the lessons I have learned since. People often come up to me and ask how I’m able to handle a full-time job, run a non-profit, pursue hobbies like photography or speaking at conferences while also maintaining an unhealthy habit of binge-watching TV shows. Hard work and ambition have a lot to do with my successes, but it’s my passion that’s kept me motivated and moving forward, especially if I hit a rough patch. In the last 3 years, I have learnt and understood so much more about what it means to have and pursue one’s passions, and I’d like to share a bit about that with all of you today.</p>

  <p>As I settled on the topic of “passion,” I did what all of us have been taught to do. I went to Google and I looked up its definition. Here are a few that I copied over: “Passion is a strong desire that can get you to do amazing things,” “Passion is an emotion to be acted upon,” and my personal favourite, “When you have passion for something, you love it even when you hate it.” Think about the strong desire it took to get you your diploma today, the emotions you’ve gone through to get here, the love of stepping your first foot on campus, getting a drink at Steins, trying to find somewhere to study in Robarts, having a snowball fight on Front Campus, to the parts you hated, like studying for exams. All of that hard work and late nights paid off.</p>

  <p><strong>Now what?</strong> Graduating from UofT takes hard work and ambition, and as you are all sitting here today, I know you are all hard workers filled with ambition. As you step out into the real world, whether you are starting your first job, going back to school for further education, or taking some time off to explore the world, let your passions help drive those decisions.</p>

  <p>Over the past few years, I’ve realized that I can categorize most of the things I’m passionate about into four main themes: Technology, Philanthropy, Travel, and Photography.</p>

  <p>Let’s start with travel. My love for travel has pushed me to explore new places. I love to travel as it gives me a chance to experience how other cultures live, and bring some of that back into my own life...</p>
