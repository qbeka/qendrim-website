My name is Mustafa, and I had the the opportunity to be Qendrim's team member in the HackED hackathon. Off the rip, Qendrim took a leadership role, assigning the team their tasks, setting up the tech stacks, the workflows, and everything we needed to get started.

He kept us accountable, guided us when we had trouble, and gave us motivation when we felt like giving up. Despite all of this, he was humble when he too needed help, and wasn't afraid to reach out to us for help aswell. 

I'd definitely group up with him again, it was an amazing experience, and it made the entire hackathon an overall better time.
