I’ve had the pleasure of knowing Aashni for almost four years, and throughout that time, she’s been an incredible source of support and insight. As a fellow founder, I’ve always admired her ability to balance running her own startup while generously sharing advice, feedback, and encouragement with others.

Aashni has a brilliant tech mind and has consistently offered thoughtful, practical solutions to some of the trickiest challenges I’ve faced in my business. When I was evaluating who to bring on as a lead developer, she helped me assess not only the technical skills needed for the role but also the qualities that would ensure a strong cultural fit for my team. Her guidance gave me the confidence to make a decision that has had a lasting positive impact on my company.

Her investment in my company wasn’t just financial; it came with genuine belief in my vision and countless hours of guidance. Whether it’s helping refine a product, providing a fresh perspective on a tough decision, or just being a reliable cheerleader during the highs and lows of startup life, Aashni is the kind of person every founder hopes to have in their corner.
