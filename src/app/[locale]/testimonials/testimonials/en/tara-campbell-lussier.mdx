As a former tech founder I know when true talent is found in the tech space. Aashni is the linchpin in building and sustaining the tech stack in my growing company. Without her our revenue would suffer and our stress would compound. Not only is she an excellent builder, she is responsive, solution-oriented and a joy to work with! I could not recommend her more; she's an absolute gem of a professional and human.
