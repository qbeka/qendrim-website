## Overview

A gesture recognition system that translates American Sign Language into text using a Bidirectional LSTM model. The system is built for real-time responsiveness, supporting live communication.

## Key Features

- **MediaPipe & OpenCV** for landmark detection and video capture.
- **Letter, Word, and Phrase Modes** to scale communication.
- **Data Augmentation** using a 30,000+ sample dataset.

## Tech Stack

Python, TensorFlow, MediaPipe, OpenCV, Scikit-Learn

## Impact

Designed to support communication for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community using AI.
