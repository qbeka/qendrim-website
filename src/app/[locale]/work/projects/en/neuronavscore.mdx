## Overview

NeuroNavScore is a research-driven project aimed at detecting early cognitive decline using a combination of VR navigation tasks and EEG analysis. The goal was to provide a non-invasive, accessible method to detect early neuronal changes related to Alzheimer’s Disease.

## Key Features

- **VR Navigation Tasks**: Differentiated between allocentric and egocentric strategies.
- **EEG Integration**: Captured real-time brain activity using OpenBCI and Brainflow.
- **Cognitive Assessment**: Targeted regions involved in spatial memory and executive function.

## Tech Stack

Unity, C#, Python, Brainflow, OpenBCI

## Impact

1st Place winner at natHACKS 2024. Recognized for bridging neuroscience and immersive tech in healthcare innovation.
