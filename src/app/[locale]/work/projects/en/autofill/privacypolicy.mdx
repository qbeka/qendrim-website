# Privacy Policy for Promptly Autofill Extension

**Effective Date:** December 5, 2024

**Last Updated:** December 5, 2024

## 1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how the Promptly Autofill Chrome Extension (“the Extension”) collects, uses, and protects your information. By using the Extension, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 2. Information We Collect
The Extension accesses specific Gmail message contents only to extract verification codes (e.g., 2FA, OTP) relevant to autofill functionality.

We do not collect or store:

*   Your email address
*   Email metadata (sender, subject, timestamp)
*   Any unrelated email content

The Extension uses the following Google scope:

*   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`
    (read access to your Gmail messages for OTP extraction only)

## 3. How We Use Information
The Extension uses the Gmail API to:

*   Detect new incoming messages that contain verification codes.
*   Extract the relevant code using regular expressions.
*   Autofill the code into supported websites.

This data is used locally and temporarily—no data is stored, transmitted, or shared with any external servers.

## 4. Data Storage and Transmission
*   **Zero server interaction:** All processing occurs within your browser session.
*   **No persistent storage:** The Extension does not store any user data after it completes its autofill action.
*   **No analytics or tracking:** We do not log or track usage patterns or user identities.

## 5. Third-Party Access
The Extension does not share your data with any third parties.

## 6. Data Security
Even though the Extension processes data locally and doesn't store anything:

*   It only requests the minimum Gmail scopes necessary.
*   All permissions are disclosed in the Chrome Web Store listing.
*   OAuth is used for secure, user-consented access to Gmail.

## 7. User Control
You may revoke access at any time:

*   Go to your Google Account: [https://myaccount.google.com/permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
*   Remove access for "Promptly Autofill" or whichever app name is used.

You can also uninstall the extension from Chrome to immediately disable all functionality.

## 8. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with a revised "Last Updated" date.
