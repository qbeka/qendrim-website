## Overview

NovaWild is a zoo in Washington, USA. I developed their website and eCommerce platform to help increase ticket sales, simplify backend operations, and support various tools for staff.

## Key Features

- **Built on WordPress & WooCommerce**: Created an eCommerce platform for ticket sales.
- **Integrated with Square**: Payment processing, including on-premise systems.
- **Barcode Scanners**: Facilitated smooth check-in for visitors.

## Collaborators

Worked with a designer and Tara, the founder, and continue to provide updates and support.

## Impact

Enhanced ticketing and online shopping experiences for visitors and streamlined backend processes for the zoo's staff.
